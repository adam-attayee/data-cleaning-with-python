# Data Cleaning and Formatting with Python and Pandas

In this project, I utilize the power of Python and the pandas library in cleaning and formatting unstructured or poorly formatted data. The CSV file that I am working with contains inconsistent data types, poorly formatted data, and missing values.

## Overview

### Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to transform the raw data contained in the CSV file named "Customer Call List" into a well-structured and organized format. The formatted data will be prepared for handover to the call center department, where customer service representatives can efficiently reach out to each customer.


### Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**: I tackle common data issues, such as missing values and duplicate records using pandas' data cleaning functions.

- **Data Formatting**: I demonstrate techniques for formatting data, including converting data types, renaming columns, and slicing data.

- **Data Transformation**: I illustrate how to restructure data to meet the requirements of specific analysis tasks.

- **Documentation**: The project includes clear, step-by-step documentation and code comments to help you understand and replicate the data cleaning and formatting process.


## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the sample dataset used in the project. You can replace it with your own data.

- `notebook/`: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook with the Python code for data cleaning and formatting.

- `README.md`: This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
